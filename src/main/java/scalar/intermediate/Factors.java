/* Explaination of getNoOfFactors

Why Use âˆšn Optimization?
 - Instead of checking all numbers from 1 to n, we only check numbers up to âˆšn because:
 - If i is a factor of n, then n/i is also a factor.
    Example: For 36, checking until 6 is enough because pairs (6, 6) and (2, 18) cover all factors.
This reduces unnecessary iterations.

ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity
     We iterate only until âˆšn, so complexity is O(âˆšn).

ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity
       We use only a few variables (n, count, i), so space complexity is O(1).
